# WPF-Helpdesk
A WPF Helpdesk app written in C#

This is a project I did for school. It's a small helpdesk ticketing app with a database persisted in Azure. It can be modified to
use a local DB if necessary.

This app is broken in spots that require your information and connection strings. 

Database creation script included
