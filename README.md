# WPF-Helpdesk
A WPF Helpdesk app written in C#

This is a project I did for school. It's a small helpdesk ticketing app that a database persisted in Azure. It can be modified to
us a local DB if necessary.

This app is broken in spots that require your information and connection strings. 

 I included a database creation script to aid in starting the project.
